We can easly see that MAPD is harder then TSP.
Lest show a reduction from TSP to MAPD
Assume x is TSP instance. We will convert it to MAPD instance.
No fregile, blocks egdes.
For each Vertex of TSP we will put a package with pickup point = destenation point in this vertex.
from time 0 to deliver infinte.
So if the aignet land on a vertex he pick up and deliver the packaged immidiatly.
So he just need to travel all the vertex in a minumum time.
We kmow that TSP is NP hard so because we solve TSP with MAPD in a polynimyal reduction time.
MAPD is at least NP hard.
