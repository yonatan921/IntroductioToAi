## MAPD Problem Solver using Python 3.8

### Overview

This project aims to solve the Multi-Agent Pathfinding with Delay (MAPD) problem using various algorithms implemented in Python 3.8. The MAPD problem involves finding optimal paths for multiple agents in a given environment while considering delays in their movements.

### Getting Started

To run the program, follow the steps below:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your system.


## How to run
```bash
python3 main.py --file example.txt --algo Astar
```

You can use --algo with Astar Gready RealTime

## Theoretical bonus
The answer to the theoretical bonus in theoretical_bonus.txt

## The heuristic
The heuristic we used is MST as we learned in class which is relife of TSP problem which is relife of MAPD problem
